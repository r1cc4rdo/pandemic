# [Pandemic role chooser](https://repl.it/@riccardog/Pandemic)
[Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_(board_game)) is a *board
game* from [Z-MAN games](https://www.zmangames.com/en/games/pandemic/).

### How to use the tool

The easiest way is to [run the code online on repl.it](https://repl.it/@riccardog/Pandemic).

1. On line `69`, put the names of who's going to play. It's up to 5 people.
2. On line `70`, change to `False` if you do not want the order of players to be randomized.
3. On line `71`, change to `True` to only use roles from the original board game.
4. Click on the green `run â–¶` button at the top of the screen.

### Roles cheatsheet

Find it [here](https://github.com/r1cc4rdo/pandemic/blob/master/roles.md), or `print_all_roles()` in the code.
